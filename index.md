# What is the purpose of this W3C Track?

The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) is an international community where Member organizations, a full-time staff, and the public work together to develop Web standards. Led by Web inventor and Director Tim Berners-Lee and CEO Jeffrey Jaffe, W3C's mission is to lead the World Wide Web to its full potential by developing protocols and guidelines that ensure the long-term growth of the Web.

The standards developed by W3C and other standardization bodies together makes the Web a platform for innovation, consolidation and cost efficiencies. Today, the Web that supports rich interaction, data, service and trust has become a major driving force and infrastructure for the innovation of human society. Industries transferred by the Web bring new use cases and requirements to the Web standard community and once again trigger innovation for the standard technologies, such as the standards for WebXR contents, languages enablement, Graph Data, Web Assambly, Web & Network integration, distributed identity, Machine Learning, Interleger Protocols, authentication, etc.

W3C has been collaborating with Web Conference through "W3C Track" since 2002, which is an important public forum where W3C technologies are presented. This track is one of the parallel tracks of the core conference. On W3C Track, representatives from W3C community report on the range of Web standard achievements as well as discuss the possible future work with the Web conference attendees.
